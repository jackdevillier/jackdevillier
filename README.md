# Howdy ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mini-projects to expand my horizon on various libraries, programming languages, software, etc.! I am also learning C in a course @ VT!
I love word games, so I recreated Wordle from scratch as a personal project and I look forward to programming more word games in the future!

2023 Recap:
ðŸŽ“ Classes (Virginia Tech): CS2114, CS2104
ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 (temporarily)

Feel free to check out some of my work, spanning from high school to current-day!
